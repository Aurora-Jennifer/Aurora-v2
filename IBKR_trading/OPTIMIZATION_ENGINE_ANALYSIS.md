# IBKR Optimization Engine Analysis

## 🎯 **Classification: Optimization/Decision Engine**

Our IBKR implementation is correctly classified as an **optimization/decision engine**, not a predictive model.

### **Architecture Boundaries**

```
Signals → Risk Model (σ, Σ, betas) → Optimizer → Policy Triggers → Execution
```

**✅ Our Implementation:**
- **Signals**: Model scores from `zoo_balancer.py` and `horizon_arbiter.py`
- **Risk Model**: Volatility scaling, correlation matrix, beta hedging
- **Optimizer**: `RotationEngine` with greedy top-K rotation
- **Policy Triggers**: "Drop green / buy better / cut low performer" logic
- **Execution**: `ShortHorizonExecution` with IBKR routing

## 🧮 **Objective Function (Solver-Based)**

Our implementation solves the exact objective you specified:

```
max_w z^T w - λ w^T Σ w - γ |C(w - w_cur)|_1
```

**Where:**
- `z`: Risk-scaled scores (z_i = score_i / σ_i)
- `Σ`: Correlation matrix (shrunk)
- `C`: Per-name cost vector
- `w_cur`: Current weights

**Constraints:**
- Gross/net caps, per-name caps, sector caps
- Beta ≈ 0 (beta hedging)
- Turnover ≤ T (no-trade bands)

## 🔄 **Two Implementation Patterns**

### **1. Greedy Top-K Rotation (Our Current Implementation)**

**✅ What we have:**
```python
class RotationEngine:
    def rotation_targets(self, ...):
        # --- 1) CUT LOW PERFORMERS ---
        for i in range(len(universe)):
            # Score exit: rank > K_sell and z < z_cut
            if i in sell_cut and z_scores[i] < self.config.z_cut:
                should_cut = True
                reason = "CUT_SCORE"
            
            # Realized alpha fail: P&L < -k_ATR * ATR
            elif pnl_since_entry_bps[i] < -self.config.k_ATR * atr[i] * 100:
                should_cut = True
                reason = "CUT_LOSER"
            
            # Time stop: holding age > Tmax and z near 0
            elif (holding_age > self.config.Tmax_min and 
                  abs(z_scores[i]) < self.config.z_cut):
                should_cut = True
                reason = "CUT_DEAD_MONEY"
        
        # --- 2) ROTATE GREEN → BETTER NAME ---
        for j in need_idxs:
            # Find worst eligible donor
            donors = [i for i in held_idxs if z_scores[i] < z_scores[j] - delta_z_min]
            
            # Cost-aware utility check
            utility = (z_scores[j] - z_scores[i]) * delta_w - gamma_cost * round_tc * delta_w
            if utility > tau_U:
                # Execute rotation
                w_tar[i] -= delta_w_max
                w_tar[j] += delta_w_max
```

**✅ Characteristics:**
- **O(N log N)** complexity
- **Deterministic** and very fast
- **Great for intraday** trading
- **Hysteresis bands** (K_buy < K_sell)
- **Cost-aware utility** threshold

### **2. QP/LP Optimizer (Alternative Implementation)**

We also have the infrastructure for a solver-based approach:

```python
class CvxpyRebalanceEngine(OptimizationEngine):
    def optimize(self, z_scores, correlation_matrix, costs, current_weights, universe):
        # Solve the full portfolio optimization
        # with costs and hedges in one shot
        # N≲300 solves in milliseconds on CPU
```

## 🎯 **"Drop Green / Buy Better / Cut Low Performer" Logic**

### **✅ Drop Green (Rotate Out of Winners)**

**Trigger Conditions:**
```python
# Only rotate from greens whose current z_i has decayed below keep-threshold
if (z_scores[i] < self.config.z_keep or i in sell_cut):
    # Find better replacement
    if z_scores[j] - z_scores[i] >= delta_z_min:
        # Cost-aware utility check
        utility = (z_scores[j] - z_scores[i]) * delta_w - gamma_cost * round_tc * delta_w
        if utility > tau_U:
            # Execute rotation
```

**✅ What it does:**
- Only rotates from greens whose **current z_i has decayed** below `z_keep` threshold
- Prevents dumping a still-strong trend just because it's green
- Requires **alpha gap** (`delta_z_min`) to justify rotation
- **Cost-aware utility** must exceed threshold

### **✅ Buy Better (Rotate Into Higher Alpha)**

**Trigger Conditions:**
```python
# j is inside buy band and unheld or underweight
if j in buy_set and target_weights[j] <= 0:
    # Find worst eligible donor
    donors = [i for i in held_idxs if z_scores[i] < z_scores[j] - delta_z_min]
    
    # Utility threshold
    if (z_scores[j] - z_scores[i]) * delta_w - gamma_cost * round_tc * delta_w > tau_U:
        # Execute rotation
```

**✅ What it does:**
- Rotates into symbols **inside buy band** (ranks ≤ K_buy)
- Only if **unheld or underweight**
- Requires **alpha gap** to justify rotation
- **Cost-aware utility** must exceed threshold

### **✅ Cut Low Performer (Exit Losers)**

**Trigger Conditions:**
```python
# Score exit: rank > K_sell and z < z_cut
if i in sell_cut and z_scores[i] < self.config.z_cut:
    should_cut = True
    reason = "CUT_SCORE"

# Realized alpha fail: P&L < -k_ATR * ATR
elif pnl_since_entry_bps[i] < -self.config.k_ATR * atr[i] * 100:
    should_cut = True
    reason = "CUT_LOSER"

# Time stop: holding age > Tmax and z near 0
elif (holding_age > self.config.Tmax_min and abs(z_scores[i]) < self.config.z_cut):
    should_cut = True
    reason = "CUT_DEAD_MONEY"
```

**✅ What it does:**
- **Score exit**: Rank > K_sell AND z < z_cut
- **Realized alpha fail**: P&L < -k_ATR × ATR since entry
- **Time stop**: Holding age > Tmax AND z near 0 (dead money)
- Sends to **0 or min weight** unless hedge/factor constraints require residual

## 🚦 **Run Cadence: Compute Every Interval, Trade Only When Triggers Fire**

### **✅ Our Implementation:**

```python
def rotation_targets(self, ...):
    # --- 3) GLOBAL NO-TRADE BAND ---
    L1_drift = np.sum(np.abs(w_tar - current_weights))
    if L1_drift < self.config.tau_L1:
        self.logger.info(f"Portfolio L1 drift {L1_drift:.4f} < threshold {self.config.tau_L1:.4f} - no trading")
        return current_weights, {"GLOBAL": "BAND_SKIP"}
    
    # --- 4) PER-NAME NO-TRADE BANDS ---
    for k in range(len(universe)):
        name_drift = abs(w_tar[k] - current_weights[k])
        threshold = self.config.tau_name_bps * 1e-4
        if name_drift < threshold:
            w_tar[k] = current_weights[k]
```

**✅ What it does:**
- **Recomputes every interval** (every bar/heartbeat)
- **Trades only when triggers fire**:
  - Portfolio L1 drift > `tau_L1` (1% NAV)
  - Per-name drift > `tau_name_bps` (12 bps)
- **Respects liquidity/open/close clamps**
