  This document outlines the architecture, feature selection methodology, and rigorous leakage prevention protocols of the Aurora-v2 quantitative trading platform. It details the transition to a hybrid C++/Python stack and the implementation of purged time-series cross-validation. The system implements 17+ machine learning models across multiple horizons with comprehensive temporal leakage prevention, cross-sectional feature engineering, and production-ready validation frameworks. This whitepaper provides a complete technical overview of the system's design, validation methodology, and implementation details.
