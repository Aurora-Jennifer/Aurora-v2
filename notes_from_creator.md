If you end up using this project, I’d love to hear about what you do with it.
Totally optional — I’m just curious how people apply the system.
I wouldnt trust the IBKR exeuction code btw, its completely untested, i was waiting for a new generation of models to train before i tested it,
but the entire zoo was gonna take like 2 weeks or something.

I can be reached at jtlewis204@gmail.com or my discord but ill add that later, i havent used it in a while.
